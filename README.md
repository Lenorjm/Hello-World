# Hello-World
I am really thinking about becoming a programmer. I love tech but never really thought i could do this but I'll give this my all.


Howdy! I'm Lenor, and i'm on constant quest to discover the meaning of life. I think it time i pick up that Victor Frankiel book. What's it called "Man Meaning of life" or search for life meaning or... heck something like that.
